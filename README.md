# Deep-Learning-CV-Hackathon

## Part-A (Face Recognition using Deep Learning)

*Refer to the Face_Recognition folder, has a separate README.md files to explain things out.*

## Part-B (Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Vehicles)

The pdf contains a report on what is semantic segmentation, and how it is implemented and used in autonomous vehicles. In addition to it, I have already done a project involving semantic segmentation (Steel Surface Defect Detection) which could be referred as well.

Github Link to the project: https://github.com/Manoj-152/Steel-Surface-Defect-Detection
